# FBS-Booster-1.8.9

This FBS booster IS compatible with Optifine, Patcher and every other mod.
If you find a mod that isn't compatible, please notify me.

This mod works by saving overhaul rescources, and using them when you actually need them.
It saves overhaul resources when you are tabbed out, or afk for more than 5 minutes at a time.

From my personal experience, using only Optifine and Patcher, adding this mod increased my FPS from 102 to 266 in a void world.
